# Introduction and Key Terms
This class will cover several related topics:
- Big Data: dealing with data too big to fit on one computer
- Analytics: extracting meaningful information
- Machine Learning: techniques to help when unsure how to use analytics
- Cloud Computing: how to harness multiple computers

# Big Data

- Data that cannot be stored on one computer
    - Have to distribute among multiple computers
    - Have to process using distributed algorithms
    - Can apply big data techniques to small data, but not other way around

**Structured vs Unstructured Data**
- Structured data:
    - Clearly defined data types, stored in predefined order
    - Explicitly linked
    - Easily sortable and maintainable
- Unstructured data:
    - Conglomerate of varied data types
    - No explicit links
    - Harder to collect, process, analyze

**Data Warehouse, Data Lake**
- Database: Files and programs that hold data for one pearticular set or collection.
